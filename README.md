# task0
A first Ciklum test task.
All technical requirements are present in [Ciklum Hybris Test Task.pdf](https://github.com/R0man0s/task0/files/7274241/Ciklum.Hybris.Test.Task.pdf).\
It is a simple Maven project, at first you need to copy files, then compile the project by cmd from Project directory using a command: **mvn compile**. To start all tests type: **mvn test**. To start the Project type: **java -Dexec.mainClass="starterconsole.StarterConsole"**.\
All dependencies are included into a pom file.\
You can easely manage the app by using a menu, each command has its own number. Just type a need command number and get a response.\
So, enjoy the app! :)
